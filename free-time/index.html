    <h4 id="scout">Scout</h4>
<p>I spend a lot of time as a scout leader (volunteer) for the local group of AGESCI.</p>
<p>I joined the Scout Movement as a teenager and I&rsquo;ve been a scout leader since end of 2015.</p>
<p>I think the ideas of Baden Powell (as they are implemented in Italy, at least) are an effective way to train boys and girls in many aspects of life.</p>
<p><em>No one can pass through life, any more than he can pass through a bit of country, without leaving tracks behind, and those tracks may often be helpful to those coming after him in finding their way.</em> (B.P., 1940)</p>
<h4 id="software-and-linux-related-stuff">Software and Linux-related stuff</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of a tinkerer with computer stuff. I spend some time playing and trying stuff on my systems.</p>
<p>I also did some hardware related stuff, but most thinkering is related to software:
when you use a linux distrubition there are lots of stuff you can try, set-up, configure;
moreover I also enjoying trying to do thing myself instead of relying on external services.</p>
<h4 id="cristian-and-interfaith-dialogue-associations">Cristian and interfaith dialogue associations</h4>
<p>In recent years I became interested in the jewish roots of cristianity and I&rsquo;m partially involed in
a recently-born association that focus on Critian-Jewish relations amoung young adults.</p>
<p>During my university years in Padova I&rsquo;ve been a member of F.U.C.I., an association of young catholic students
which seek to analyze and discuss matters and topics beyond their own specific curricula, with a scientific method if possibile.</p>
