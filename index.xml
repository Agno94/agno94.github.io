      <description>Scout I spend a lot of time as a scout leader (volunteer, as everyone is Italy) for the local group of AGESCI.&#xA;I joined the Scout Movement as a teenager and I&amp;rsquo;ve been a scout leader since end of 2015.&#xA;I think the ideas of Baden Powell (as they are implemented in Italy, at least) are an effective way to train boys and girls in many aspects of life.&#xA;No one can pass through life, any more than he can pass through a bit of country, without leaving tracks behind, and those tracks may often be helpful to those coming after him in finding their way.</description>
